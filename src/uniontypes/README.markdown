MiniTypeScript implements parametric polymorphism on top of STLC along with union types, intersection types, distributive conditional types, and mapped types.

An eager, purely functional language with records and subtypes and parametric polymorphism. The language has integers, booleans, recursive functions, and immutable records.

The file `example.uniontypes` has high-level examples. The file `black_box_tests.uniontypes` has black-box tests for features like polymorphism, higher-order types, string literal types, `keyof` operator, and `A[K]` type lookup operator.
